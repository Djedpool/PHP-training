 *      Write a PHP program to check if a number is an Armstrong number or not.
 *      Return true if the number is Armstrong otherwise return false.
 *      Note: An Armstrong number of three digits is an integer so that the sum of the cubes of its digits is equal to the number itself.
 *      For example, 153 is an Armstrong number since 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3 = 153
